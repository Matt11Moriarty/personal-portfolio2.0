# Professional Portfolio

## Description

As a soon-to-be-graduate of a full-stack coding bootcamp, I needed a good way to share with potential employers my projects, and skills as a developer. What better way to do so than to build a fully deployed portfolio with React?

In building this application, I gained experience with deploying sites with Netlify, as well as building and using functional components using React best practices. 

The experience gained from this project has given me confidence in building front end applications with React, a valuable skill as I strive toward a career as a software developer.
